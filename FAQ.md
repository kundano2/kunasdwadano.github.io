# Frequently Asked Question
A compilation of frequently asked questions, and short answers for them.

## Why do I keep getting 404 errors?
The most likely reason is that you are entering a subdirectory that doesn't exist. Ex: pleasedontbock.me/eggs. If you know this isn't the case and it is something else, please open an issue.

## Why is a site marked as deceptive?
Google will sometimes mistake a traditional site for a scam site. The best thing you can do in this situation is to report it as a mistake [here](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/?hl=en)

## Where can I get more links?
You can get more links by clicking the "Community" button on the homepage, or by going to discord.gg/unblock. There I will have more links posted, and you can check out other cool proxy sites!

## Why is it when I click on a button, nothing happens?
Sometimes caching leads to a button not working. Try pressing `crtl + shift + r` to fix this. If the issue persists, open an issue.

## What if my issue isn't listed on here?
No worries! You can contact me on Matrx (degenerate0001:matrix.org), Discord (Degenerate#0001), or by opening an issue.
